      <h3>Charlie Jacobs</h3>
      <p> I'm Charlie, student at City University of London, studying computer science with a desire to move into the financial
          world in the future. I have previous experience in stock trading using fundamental and technical analysis but would
          love to learn more about deep learning algos and the future of the industry as a whole. I have very little prior 
          knowledge in coding so this has been largely my first experience with it and am enjoying it so far! parsnip</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Solar System</h3>
    <p>
	My project started out as a simple animated solar system which allowed me to
        demonstrate multiple skills I have picked up throughout bootcamp. For example
        the use of classes and arrays for the planets in my sketch, the use of if 
        statements for the interactive buttons, and the addition of atmospheric music
        to compliment the sketch's animation. The stars background was also created 
        in processing using loops and then screenshotted and imported as an image. 
        Of course the sun is far too small in this sketch, the size and orbit speeds 
        of the planets are somewhat accurate relative to each other however I would not 
        rely on it! I find now that the sketch is more relaxing than informative which 
        wasn't my initial intention however I feel it works well considering I could not
        code at all just two weeks ago, proves bootcamp has been successful! One issue I did
        discover too late in the process was that I wrote the sketch on a 1440p display,
        meaning when I set the size of the sketch to 1000,1100 it looked fine on my screen
        but will be too large for a 1080p display, this is something I will have to take
        into account for projects in the future.</p>
